Normalize.css by Pirosauro
==========================

 

My customized version of
[normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) includes:

-   basic support for IE6/7 I needed it for some projects in China[^1]

-   various improvements for mobile

-   minor other improvements

 

Most of the credits go to the original authors of normalize.css

 

[^1]: Needed for some projects during my experience in Shanghai, where around
30% of users stick to IE \< 8
